This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of Electric Vehicles (EVs) using Python and statistical methods. The project demonstrates how data science can be applied to automotive datasets for actionable insights, recommendation systems, and hypothesis testing.

Repository Contents
EV_Data_Analysis_Project.ipynb: Jupyter notebook with all code and output for data analysis, visualization, filtering, recommendations, and statistical testing.

EV_Data_Analysis_Project.pdf: Walkthrough document with code, explanations, and screenshots of key steps and results.

FEV-data-Excel.xlsx: (Add if available) Raw dataset containing specifications of electric vehicles.

Project Overview
Filtering & Grouping: Select EVs by budget and minimum range; group by manufacturer.

Statistics & Aggregates: Calculate average battery capacities and identify consumption outliers.

Visualization: Explore correlations between battery capacity and vehicle range using scatter plots.

Recommendation System: Custom Python class to suggest top EVs by user criteria (budget, range, capacity).

Inferential Statistics: Conduct hypothesis testing (t-test) on engine power between leading manufacturers.

Key Features
Data Cleaning: Import and inspect a multi-attribute EV dataset using pandas.

EV Filtering: Identify cars fitting user requirements (price, range) and summarize by manufacturer.

Energy Consumption Analysis: Outlier detection using IQR for energy consumption.

Relationship Visualization: Show the positive correlation between battery size and EV range.

Recommendation Engine: Python class for tailored EV suggestions to customers.

Statistical Testing: Assess difference in engine power between Tesla and Audi using t-tests.

Conclusions & Actionable Insights: Business-focused summary and recommendations.
